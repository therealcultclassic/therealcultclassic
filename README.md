- 👀 I’m interested in learning creative coding, making & computer software (to bring my many ideas to life).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, css, javascript, and python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on many app ideas I have, but to start I'm focusing on an idea for an app with a strong focus on action-oriented environmentalism.
